// Spaces: a space is a key, a display name, a member list and a listing of the workspaces that
// belong to it (see docs/spaces.md).
//
// Each space is one Durable Object (`SpaceDurableObject`), addressed by the space's key. There is
// no directory of spaces: a key is taken once the object under it has been claimed, and that
// object's member list is the only authority on who belongs to the space. Every member's User DO
// keeps a presentation-only mirror of their memberships, which the space pushes to.
//
// The listing of workspaces runs the other way. Which space a workspace belongs to is recorded by
// its owner's User DO, which registers the workspace here and keeps the entry current; the space
// decides whether that owner may add to it. An entry of the listing is held by the owner it is
// listed under: nobody else updates or drops it. Where a workspace belongs is never decided from
// the listing, which only follows its owner's record. An entry's address within the space, its
// slug, is the space's alone: the space gives it, and no other object knows it.
//
// A member's role applies to the workspaces the space lists. The owner's User DO asks, for a
// workspace whose record points here, which role a profile's membership gives them on it (see
// `SpaceModel.workspaceRole`), and the space answers with one only for a workspace it lists
// under that owner, so both sides have to agree. The workspace's Overseer combines the answer
// with its own sharing. Each role given out is remembered as a lease. When a member is removed
// or lowered, or a workspace leaves the listing, the leases that no longer hold are queued as
// revocations, which the space's alarm delivers to each workspace's Overseer, so that no open
// session outlives the membership or the listing it was opened through.
//
// A space is never published, but a workspace can be, to everyone signed in to the deployment,
// and its entry says so (`SpaceWorkspaceInfo.published`, which its owner's User DO registers
// with the rest). Someone who is not a member may open the space while it lists such an entry,
// as a visitor: they see its info and its published entries, and nothing else of it. A visitor
// holds no role in the space, so the space gives them none on a workspace and no lease.
//
// Trust: every method `SpaceDurableObject` exposes takes the acting user as a plain parameter,
// exactly like `OverseerDurableObject.open(userId, profileId, ...)`. Its only callers are
// `AuthenticatedApiImpl` (server.ts) and `UserDurableObject` (user.ts) -- never a client, gadget,
// gatekeeper or agent -- so the parameter is authoritative. A client only ever holds a
// `SpaceClientInterface`, which closes over the caller fixed at open time.
//
// The rules live in `SpaceModel`, pure logic over typed storage so it is unit-testable; the
// Durable Object is a thin shell adding the account lookup, the mirror pushes and the alarm that
// delivers the revocations.
